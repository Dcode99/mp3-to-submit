1. This is duplicated code. This can be solved by creating a function to carry out these lines.
3. This is feature envy. This can be fixed by moving it to the Jenkins class.
4. This is also duplicated code, the same expression is duplicated 4 times in a row. 
This can be solved by looping it, which also requires the break statement to be changed in order 
to make sure it breaks from the outer loop.
6. I can't find any code in the xml file duplicated 8 times or more that isn't under the target directory which is
listed as something we shouldn't be refactoring for this question. If I had found duplicated code here I could have made a global
method to implement the task and use that in each file where the duplicated code was used.
